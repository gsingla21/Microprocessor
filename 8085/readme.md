The Intel 8085 microprocessor is an NMOS 8-bit device. It has a 16-bit address bus and an 8- bit data bus. The total addressable memory size of 8085 microprocessor is 64 KB. It has a set of registers which contribute to the effective and efficient working of the microprocessor.
To view the overall working of the 8085 microprocessor, a kit has been designed so that the programming on this microprocessor can be best understood by the students.
The kit consists of the following components:

 A 6-byte display screen which is further divided into two parts, one containing 4-byte displaying the address and the remaining 2-bytes which are used to display the data.

 A keypad which is used to operate the kit.

 A 40-pin 8085 microprocessor.

 A 20-pin address latch used to manage the address transfer from the AD bus.

 A memory unit which consists of three 28-pin IC’s which are used to provide memory to the processor.

 A 24-pin timer controller which is used to control the clock frequency.

 A 40-pin I/O Lines which are used to provide input to the microprocessor and to store the output from the microprocessor.

 A 40-pin KB/Display controller used to control the display.
